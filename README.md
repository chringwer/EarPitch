# Ear Pitch  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chringwer/EarPitch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chringwer/EarPitch) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/chringwer/EarPitch/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/chringwer/EarPitch?branch=master)


An ear training application for musicians.

This app is rather meant as an exercise for me to play with Java 8 and JavaFX but still I'm planning on adding some more features and publish release builds at some point in the future. 

So if anyone is interested in contributing or would like to see a particular feature, please contact me.

## Run application

You need to install Oracle JDK 8 and Maven in order build and run the app from sources. The following command will take care of the rest.

```
mvn jfx:run
```
